Midi Control 1.1, a plugin for Winamp
-------------------------------------

This Winamp plugin allows you to use a MIDI device, such as a keyboard,
to control Winamp's functionality. Many musicians will have a MIDI
device hooked up to their computer, and this can be made useful, even
when not being used for its normal purpose.

This plugin allows access to all major Winamp functions by assigning
them to notes, which can then be generated by the keyboard. For example,
D, in any octave, is Play. It also makes use of mod and pitch wheel messages,
if present. For the rest of the assignments, please see the Midi Control
configuration dialog.

New in Version 1.1
------------------

- Support for volume control via the keyboard (keys A and B)

- Support for Tascam US-428 (CS-10 compatible) transport buttons.

Installation
------------

Use the installer to install the plugin to your Winamp plugin directory,
which defaults to c:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins. Restart Winamp. Winamp

Usage
-----

Use the configuration dialog:

Preferences->Plugins->General Purpose->Midi Control and click Configure.

This dialog shows the various key assignments, and allows the MIDI port
and channel to be chosen. Alternatively, the Autoconfigure feature can
be used if you don't remember what device or channel your MIDI device is
sending on.
